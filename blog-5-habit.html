      <h2>1. Stay Consistent with Exercise</h2>
      <p>Exercising regularly — even 20–30 minutes a day — builds strength, endurance, and confidence. Consistency is more important than intensity.</p>

      <h2>2. Prioritize Sleep</h2>
      <p>Sleep allows your body to recover, rebuild muscle, and regulate hormones. Aim for 7–8 hours per night to maximize results.</p>

      <h2>3. Eat Balanced Meals</h2>
      <p>Include proteins, healthy fats, complex carbs, and plenty of vegetables in your meals. This fuels your workouts and daily energy needs.</p>

      <h2>4. Stay Hydrated</h2>
      <p>Water supports every function in your body. Drink at least 8 glasses daily — more if you work out regularly.</p>

      <h2>5. Practice Mindfulness</h2>
      <p>A healthy body begins with a healthy mind. Take time each day to breathe, reflect, and stay mentally focused on your goals.</p>
