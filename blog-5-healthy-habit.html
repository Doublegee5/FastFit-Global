      <h2>1. Drink Plenty of Water</h2>
      <p>Water is essential for digestion, energy, and detox. Aim for 8+ cups per day to stay refreshed and alert.</p>

      <h2>2. Stay Physically Active</h2>
      <p>Engage in at least 30 minutes of movement each day — walking, jogging, yoga, or workouts. Consistency matters.</p>

      <h2>3. Eat Nutritious Meals</h2>
      <p>Focus on whole foods — vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and healthy fats — and limit processed and sugary foods.</p>

      <h2>4. Sleep Well</h2>
      <p>Good sleep fuels recovery. Strive for 7–9 hours of rest each night to support your body and mind.</p>

      <h2>5. Practice Mindfulness</h2>
      <p>Stress affects health. Meditate, breathe deeply, and take breaks. A calm mind promotes a strong body.</p>
